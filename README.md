Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science, used to organize, manage, and store data efficiently.

A **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)** is a versatile data structure that combines the behaviors of both a **Queue (FIFO)** and a **Stack (LIFO)**. Unlike a traditional Queue, a Deque allows elements to be added or removed from both ends (front and rear). This flexibility makes it suitable for various use cases, such as managing scheduling problems or designing cache mechanisms.

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deque**, showcasing its operations and functionalities, along with code examples to demonstrate its usage.

## Features
ðŸ’¡ **Linked Implementation**: A deque implementation using linked nodes for dynamic memory allocation and flexible resizing.

ðŸ”§ **Contiguous Implementation**: A deque implementation using a fixed-size array, offering fast indexing but limited by pre-defined capacity.

- **Append**: Add elements to the front or rear of the deque.
- **Serve**: Remove elements from the front or rear of the deque.
- **Flexibility**: Supports operations at both ends, unlike traditional queues.

## Applications
- **Task Scheduling**
- **Cache Design**
- **Palindrome Checking**
- **Sliding Window Problems**
